--- User Stories ---

User downloads, unpacks, installs (ick)
    barley start
    opens browser
    sees nice intro page

Running barley at the command line:
    barley has three commands: "start", "init", and "run"
    "start" is just "init" if needed followed by "run"
    all three commands take an optional directory to be the project directory
        if none is given, then the project directory defaults to the current directory
    "init" copies the "seed" skeleton project into the project directory
        it creates the project directory if needed
        it fails if the project directory isn't empty
        if the current directory contains a "seed" directory, that is used as the seed
            otherwise, the "seed" directory in the data dir (via cabal install) is used
            if even that is missing, "init" fails and complains
    "run" checks that the project directory is okay - that is, was once "init"'d
        if fails if it wasn't
    if barley is run w/o a command, it is treated as "start"
        note that no project dir can be named in this case
            (as it would be taken as the barley command)

User goes intro page
    clicks on Sample page
    sees result
    told to go to file
    opens file
    file contains text on a suggested edit
    user returns to browser
    reloads
    "WOW"

User goes to intro page
    clicks add
    fills out form w/name and description
    system generates file
    goes to file to edit
    reloads
    "WOW"

User reloads a new page
    there is a compilation error
    error page directs them what to do next
    the edits in the file
    there is a reload button

User types url
    do the casing, load the right stuff
    
--- future User Stories ----
There is file of allowed URL to file mappings so that not ALL of the project dir is mapped

When running "barley init", if the current dir is not-empty, it won't overwrite
    there is a "--force" flag to overwrite that

=== TODO DONE ===
[m] create a playground dir and exclude it's contents (but not it) from the repo
[m] notice that the directory started in is empty and call init-project
[m] if init is called from start, then it shouldn't complain about the non-empty dir
[m] init and start take an optional directory to cd into first
